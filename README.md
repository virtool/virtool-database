# virtool-database
## An official virus reference database for Virtool

**This is a temporary solution for distributing the official database**

**This collection of virus records still requires major revision and curation. There are viral sequences that are internal to the Centre For Plant Health and are not available in GenBank.**

In the future, this repository will contain individual virus documents so changes can be easily viewed on GitHub. Releases will been in the form of a viruses.json.gz file.
